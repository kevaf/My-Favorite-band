         <h2>About.</h2>
        <p>Imagine Dragons is an American pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of lead singer 
            Dan Reynolds, lead guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman.
            Identifying as 'genreless', the imagine dragons was formed in 2009. They first unveiled their strong 
            passion and gernre-bending abilities with a series independently released albums that quickly earned 
            grassroot following. According to one of the band members, the name <em>Imagine Dragons,</em> is an 
            anagram made from letters of different words.
